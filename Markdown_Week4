AI Method:
- Using a simple computer vision detection model
- Chosen because it is lightweight, fast, and commonly used for identifying objects
- Detects hazards like spills, blocked exits, or any accidents or obstacles.

Data Acqusition Plan:
Sources:
- Public online image datasets
- Kaggle datasets
Data Type:
- Indoor images of hazards and walkways
- No personal or identifying information
Ethical Notes:
- No facial recognition
- Data only used for hazard detection
- Only public or non-personal data
Limitations
- Poor lighting may causes issues and missing hazards.
- It could make mistakes if the environment is very different from the training data
- Real-time detection might be slow on weaker devices

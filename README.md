# AI Innovators Project - Public Safety & Accessibility

# Group Members and Roles:
- Dion Hutch - AI Ethicist
- Dion Hutch - Product Designer
- Dion Hutch - Systems Analyst

# Project Ideas:
1. An AI system that scans camera feeds for hazards like spills, blocked exits, and accessibility barriers, alerting staff quickly.
2. An AI tool that maps buildings and identifies inaccessible routes for wheelchair users or individuals with mobility challenges.
3. A computer vision model that detects overcrowding and helps redirect foot traffic in large public spaces like malls, theaters, and campuses.

# Group Charter:
• Communication: GitHub and email
• Tools: GitHub, Google Slides
• Meeting Plan: To be set once we make contact. Until then, work in being completed individually.

# Product Choice:
We will create an AI-driven safety assistant that analyzes camera footage to identify hazards and accessibility issues.
By detecting risks early and sending alerts to staff, our tool improves safety, reduces liability, and offers smoother facility operations.

# Stragegy:
The project will use a computer object detection model to identify hazards from camera footage.
This method was chosen because it is lightweight, fast, and commonly used for identifying objects.

# Data Search Plan:
• Public online image datasets
• Kaggle Datasets

# Limitations
- Poor lighting may causes issues and missing hazards.
- It could make mistakes if the environment is very different from the training data
- Real-time detection might be slow on weaker devices

# Ethics Overview
- The system will not identify people, only hazards
- Data will be from public or non-personal sources
- A human should always confirm alerts before alerting anyone.

# Ethical Use Statement
- This tool will only be used to detech safety hazards and is not for survelliance or tracking.

# Sale Market
- Our tool will be userful for any larger public areas, such as malls, schools, walking paths or areas and any building where it is hard for staff to keep an eye on all locations at once.
